# Employee Directory

Built a responsive employee directory with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Wrote JavaScript programming to update the employee data dynamically with AJAX through the Random User Generator API (employee info updates each time the app displays to simulate real-time changes to a database).

Click on an employeeâ€™s card to reveal a modal window which displays a custom JavaScript modal that I wrote to display additional information about that employee.
